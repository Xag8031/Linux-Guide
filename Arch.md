# [Arch (Arch Linux)](https://archlinux.org/)

Arch Linux is an independently developed, Linux distribution targeted at advanced Linux users. It uses 'pacman', its package manager, to provide updates to the latest software applications with full dependency tracking. Operating on a rolling release system, Arch can be installed from a boot drive, cd or via an server. The default install provides a solid base that enables users to create a custom installation. In addition, the Arch Build System (ABS) provides a way to easily build new packages, modify the configuration of stock packages, and share these packages with other users via the Arch Linux user repository.
